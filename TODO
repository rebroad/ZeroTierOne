=We need to gracefully deal with ipset not being found - do we really need to depend on it?
=Create local firewall functionality that mimicks the ZT Central firewall
=if findip finds no result, then at least show which peer recommended the ztaddr
=Experiment with disabling conntrack for ZeroTier traffic - improve performance?
=See if zerotier offers bandwidth management/quotes - we want quotes for ztaddrs and IP addrs (and ensure traffic via PLANETS/MOONS is logged against the ztaddr and its IP addresses)
=Expand peers CLI (arg=extra) to show networks for each leaf
=Explore existing lowBandwidthModeEnabled functionality
=Explain what we're sending in the PACKET_TO logs (see if we can combined PACKET_TO1 and PACKET_TO2 logging)
=Explain what we're sending in the PACKET_SEND_ATTEMPT logs
=Explain what we're receiving in the PACKET_FROM log messages
=Create a way to assign friendly names to ztaddrs (for use in logging and in CLI outputs)
=Why are we using "rx" and "tx" in functions instead of a bool?
=Remove /stats/wire-packets and modify /stats instead. Make it sort by total bytes (tx and rx) per peer in descending order. Don't collect stats for "wirePacketErrors", we're just collecting: PacketsIncoming, PacketsOutgoing, PackingsIncomingOK, PacketsOutgoingOK, BytesIncoming, BytesOutgoing, BytesIncomingOK, BytesOutgoingOK
=In the stats CLI, we'll show new columns for: Pkts Rx (%ok), Pkts Tx (%ok), Bytes Rx (%ok), Bytes Tx (%ok) - i.e. the percentage of OK packats can be calculated within the CLI display and shown in brackets
=In stats CLI, what's the difference between stats.peerIP and peerKey.second ?
=In stats CLI, what is the purpose of the combinedKey variable?
=Remove firstIncomingSeen and firstOutgoingSeen - we can use PacketsIncoming and PacketsOutgoing instead if they are still used for logging.
=Create a document to document all the endpoints available to the CLI
