=We need to gracefully deal with ipset not being found - do we really need to depend on it?
=Create local firewall functionality that mimicks the ZT Central firewall
=if findip finds no result, then at least show which peer recommended the ztaddr

=Expand peers CLI (arg=extra) to show networks for each leaf
