= Port Usage - show "1st", "2nd", "3rd" instead
= When we remove a peer we should remove it from the stats too
=We need to gracefully deal with ipset not being found - do we really need to depend on it?
= Create local firewall functionality that mimicks the ZT Central firewall
= if findip finds no result, then at least show which peer recommended the ztaddr
= Experiment with disabling conntrack for ZeroTier traffic - improve performance?
= See if zerotier offers bandwidth management/quotas - we want quotes for ztaddrs and IP addrs (and ensure traffic via PLANETS/MOONS is logged against the ztaddr and its IP addresses)
= Expand peers CLI (arg=extra) to show networks for each leaf
= Explain what we're sending in the PACKET_TO logs (see if we can combined PACKET_TO1 and PACKET_TO2 logging)
= Explain what we're sending in the PACKET_SEND_ATTEMPT logs
= Explain what we're receiving in the PACKET_FROM log messages
= Create a way to assign friendly names to ztaddrs (for use in logging and in CLI outputs)
